#I2c Project
TM32 I2C Master/Slave Communication Example

This project demonstrates basic Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication between two STM32 microcontrollers (or an STM32 and an I2C peripheral) configured as a Master and a Slave. It showcases how to send data from a Master board to a Slave board using I2C, with visual feedback provided by on-board LEDs.
